# Stochastic SIR Model

We consider a stochastic SIR (Susceptible–Infectious–Recovered) model for the 
spread of an infectious disease in a *closed population* of size $N$, 
meaning there are no births, deaths, or migration. The population is divided 
into three compartments: susceptible (S), infectious (I), and recovered (R). 
Initially, all individuals are susceptible except for $m$ infectious
individuals.

Note that most of the literature on SIR models assumes a deterministic
model, where the compartments are treated as continuous and are 
described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). 

Each infectious individual makes contact with any given member of the
population according to a time-homogeneous Poisson process with rate
$\lambda/N$, where $\lambda > 0$. Thus, each infectious individual makes contact 
with any other individual at an overall rate of $\lambda$, independent of the 
population size. 

The duration of the infectious period for each individual is assumed to follow 
an exponential distribution:
$$
I \sim \text{Exp}(\gamma),
$$
where $\gamma > 0$ is the recovery rate.

Let $S(t)$ and $I(t)$ denote the number of susceptible and infectious
individuals at time $t \geq 0$, respectively. Under the assumptions above,
the process
$$
\{(S(t), I(t)) : t \geq 0\}
$$
forms a continuous-time Markov process, since both infection and recovery
events are exponentially distributed and are therefore memoryless. Since
$N$ is fixed, we have $R(t) = N - S(t) - I(t)$, and thus the process can be
described by the pair $(S(t), I(t))$.

## Transition Rates

- **Infection Event:**

  $$
  (s, i, r) \to (s - 1, i + 1, r)
  $$

  occurs at rate

  $$
  \frac{\lambda}{N} \, s \, i,
  $$

  for $s > 0$ and $i > 0$.

- **Recovery Event:**

  $$
  (s, i, r) \to (s, i - 1, r + 1)
  $$

  occurs at rate

  $$
  \gamma \, i,
  $$

  for $i > 0$.

## Partial Observations and Noisy Measurements

Suppose we only observe the initial state and the number of infectious 
individuals $I(t)$ at discrete time points $t = 0, 1, \ldots, T$. The true 
number of infectious individuals is unobserved (latent), and instead we observe
a noisy measurement that may either overestimate or underestimate the 
true count.

We model the observed counts $Y_t$ in this article using a 
Poisson observation model:
$$
Y_t \mid I(t) \sim \operatorname{Pois}(I(t)).
$$
To account for over-dispersion, one could instead use a negative binomial
observation model.

We are now in a State Space Model (SSM) setup, where the latent state is 
$\bigl(S(t), I(t)\bigr)$, and the observations are $Y_t$. Note that due to
the memoryless property of the exponential distribution, the latent state
$(S(t), I(t))$ is fully determined by the initial state and the sequence of
infection and recovery events that have occurred up to time $t$, thus a
Markov process.

# Why Standard MCMC Methods Are Infeasible

If one wanted to use standard MCMC methods to estimate the joint posterior of
the parameters and latent states, one would need to compute the exact
transition probabilities for the SIR model, which quickly becomes 
infeasible as the number of infectious individuals increases. We illustrate how
this can be done using matrix exponentiation for small populations.

The probability distribution of the state at time $t$ is given by:
$$
P(t) = e^{Qt},
$$
where $Q$ is the generator matrix of the Markov process, which contains the
transition rates between states. 

We define functions below to generate the state space for a small SIR system, 
build the generator matrix, and compute the transition probabilities at a 
given time $t$.

```{r transition-probabilities}
# Generate state space for small SIR system
generate_sir_states <- function(N) {
  # Returns all (s, i) pairs where s + i <= N
  states <- expand.grid(s = 0:N, i = 0:N)
  states <- subset(states, s + i <= N)
  states <- states[order(states$s, states$i), ]
  states
}

# Build generator matrix Q
build_generator_matrix <- function(states, lambda, gamma, N) {
  n_states <- nrow(states)
  Q <- matrix(0, n_states, n_states)

  for (k in 1:n_states) {
    s <- states$s[k]
    i <- states$i[k]

    rate_infection <- (lambda / N) * s * i
    rate_recovery <- gamma * i

    # Infection transition
    if (s > 0 && i > 0) {
      next_state <- c(s - 1, i + 1)
      idx <- which(states$s == next_state[1] & states$i == next_state[2])
      Q[k, idx] <- rate_infection
    }

    # Recovery transition
    if (i > 0) {
      next_state <- c(s, i - 1)
      idx <- which(states$s == next_state[1] & states$i == next_state[2])
      Q[k, idx] <- rate_recovery
    }

    # Diagonal: exit rate
    Q[k, k] <- -(rate_infection + rate_recovery)
  }

  Q
}

# Compute transition probabilities at time t
compute_transition_probs <- function(lambda, gamma, N, t, init_state) {
  states <- generate_sir_states(N)
  Q <- build_generator_matrix(states, lambda, gamma, N)

  P <- expm(Q * t) # matrix exponential

  init_index <- which(states$s == init_state[1] & states$i == init_state[2])
  p_t <- P[init_index, ]

  data.frame(
    s = states$s,
    i = states$i,
    prob = p_t
  )
}
```

This can then be run to compute the transition probabilities for a given 
state and time point. For example, if we have a population of size $N=5$ with
state $(S(t), I(t)) = (4, 1)$ at time $t$, we can compute the transition
probabilities for the next time point $t+1$ as

```{r transition-probabilities-example}
# Example with very small population
lambda <- 1.0
gamma <- 0.5
N <- 5 # Small population
t <- 1 # Time point
init_state <- c(4, 1) # (s, i)

transition_probs <- compute_transition_probs(
  lambda, gamma, N, t, init_state
)

# Show the most probable next states
transition_probs[order(-transition_probs$prob), ][1:5, ]
```

Note, that this scales poorly with larger populations, as the number of states
is given by
$$
N+2 \choose 2,
$$
which for $N=100$ is already over 5000 states. Thus, this whole approach
is only feasible for very small populations. 

# Simulate data

We will simulate data from the SIR model with the following parameters:
- At $t=0$ we have $S(0) = 90$, $I(0) = 10$ and $R(0) = 0$.
- Infection rate $\lambda=1.5$ and removal rate $\gamma=0.5$.
- We observe the initial state at $t=0$ complete, and then noisy version of 
infectious individuals at times $t=1, \ldots, 10$ representing observations for
each day.

We can simulate using the fact that we have two independent
exponential distribution, so an event occurs at rate of the sum of the rates.

```{r simulate-sir functions}
# --- Simulation settings and true parameters ---
n_total <- 500 # Total population size
init_infected <- 70 # Initially infectious individuals
init_state <- c(n_total - init_infected, init_infected) # (s, i) at time 0
t_max <- 10 # Total number of days to simulate
true_lambda <- 0.5 # True infection parameter
true_gamma <- 0.2 # True removal parameter

# --- Functions for simulating the epidemic ---

epidemic_step <- function(state, lambda, gamma, n_total) {
  t <- 0
  t_end <- 1
  s <- state[1]
  i <- state[2]
  while (t < t_end && i > 0) {
    rate_infection <- (lambda / n_total) * s * i
    rate_removal <- gamma * i
    rate_total <- rate_infection + rate_removal
    if (rate_total <= 0) break
    dt <- rexp(1, rate_total)
    if (t + dt > t_end) break
    t <- t + dt
    # Decide which event occurs:
    if (runif(1) < rate_infection / rate_total) {
      # Infection event
      s <- s - 1
      i <- i + 1
    } else {
      # Removal event
      i <- i - 1
    }
  }
  c(s, i)
}

simulate_epidemic <- function(
    n_total, init_infected, lambda, gamma, t_max) {
  states <- matrix(0, nrow = t_max, ncol = 2)
  # initial state at t = 0
  state <- c(n_total - init_infected, init_infected)
  for (t in 1:t_max) {
    state <- epidemic_step(state, lambda, gamma, n_total)
    states[t, ] <- state
  }
  states
}
```

Now, we generate some data:

```{r simulate-data}
# Simulate an epidemic dataset
true_states <- simulate_epidemic(
  n_total, init_infected, true_lambda, true_gamma, t_max
)
latent_i <- true_states[, 2]

observations <- rpois(length(latent_i), lambda = latent_i)

# Display simulated data: time, susceptible, latent infectious, observed counts
print(data.frame(
  time = 1:t_max, s = true_states[, 1], i = true_states[, 2], y = observations
))
```

And plot it:

```{r plot-simulated-data}
#| fig.alt: "Simulated epidemic data"
# Function to create a tidy dataset for ggplot
prepare_data_for_plot <- function(states, observations, t_max) {
  # Organize the data into a tidy format
  data <- data.frame(
    time = 1:t_max,
    s = states[, 1],
    i = states[, 2],
    y = observations
  )

  # Convert to long format for ggplot
  data_long <- data %>%
    gather(key = "state", value = "count", -time)

  data_long
}

# Function to plot the epidemic data
plot_epidemic_data <- function(data_long, t_max) {
  ggplot(data_long, aes(x = time, y = count, color = state)) +
    geom_line(linewidth = 1.2) +
    scale_color_manual(values = c("s" = "blue", "i" = "red", "y" = "green")) +
    labs(
      x = "Time (Days)", y = "Count",
      title = "Susceptible, Infected, and Observed Counts"
    ) +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(legend.title = element_blank()) +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:t_max) +
    theme(
      axis.title = element_text(size = 12),
      plot.title = element_text(size = 14, hjust = 0.5)
    )
}

# Prepare data for plotting
data_long <- prepare_data_for_plot(true_states, observations, t_max)

# Plot the results
plot_epidemic_data(data_long, t_max)
```

# Bayesian Inference with PMMH

We are interested in performing Bayesian inference in this setup, and define 
the priors as follows:
\begin{align*}
	\lambda &\sim \operatorname{Normal^+}(0, 1^2), \\
	\gamma &\sim \operatorname{Normal^+}(0, 2^2),
\end{align*}
where $\operatorname{Normal^+}$ denotes a truncated at $0$ normal distribution. 

```{r priors}
# Define the log-prior for the parameters
log_prior_lambda <- function(lambda) {
  extraDistr::dhnorm(lambda, sigma = 1, log = TRUE)
}

log_prior_gamma <- function(gamma) {
  extraDistr::dhnorm(gamma, sigma = 2, log = TRUE)
}

log_priors <- list(
  lambda = log_prior_lambda,
  gamma = log_prior_gamma
)
```

We now define the initial state, transition and likelihood functions for the
SIR model. 

```{r sir-functions}
init_fn_epidemic <- function(num_particles) {
  # Return a matrix with particles rows; each row is the initial state (s, i)
  matrix(
    rep(init_state, each = num_particles),
    nrow = num_particles,
    byrow = FALSE
  )
}

transition_fn_epidemic <- function(particles, lambda, gamma, t) {
  new_particles <- t(apply(particles, 1, function(state) {
    s <- state[1]
    i <- state[2]
    if (i == 0) {
      return(c(s, i))
    }
    epidemic_step(state, lambda, gamma, n_total)
  }))
  new_particles
}

log_likelihood_fn_epidemic <- function(y, particles) {
  # particles is expected to be a matrix with columns (s, i)
  dpois(y, lambda = particles[, 2], log = TRUE)
}
```

Now we can run the PMMH algorithm to estimate the posterior distribution. 
For this vignette we only use a small number of iterations (1000) and 2 chains 
(and we also modify the tuning to only use 100 iterations with a burn-in of 10).
In practice, these should be much higher.

```{r run-pmmh}
result <- bayesSSM::pmmh(
  y = observations,
  m = 1000,
  init_fn = init_fn_epidemic,
  transition_fn = transition_fn_epidemic,
  log_likelihood_fn = log_likelihood_fn_epidemic,
  log_priors = log_priors,
  pilot_init_params = list(
    c(lambda = 0.5, gamma = 0.5),
    c(lambda = 1, gamma = 1)
  ),
  burn_in = 200,
  num_chains = 2,
  param_transform = list(lambda = "log", gamma = "log"),
  tune_control = default_tune_control(pilot_m = 100, pilot_burn_in = 10),
  verbose = TRUE,
  seed = 1405,
)
```

We get convergence warnings as expected, but the posterior is still centered 
around the true value.

We can access the chains and plot the densities:

```{r chains}
chains <- result$theta_chain
```

For $\lambda$:

```{r lambda-plot}
#| fig.alt: "Density plot of lambda chains"

ggplot(chains, aes(x = lambda, fill = factor(chain))) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Density plot of lambda chains",
    x = "Value",
    y = "Density",
    fill = "Chain"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

And for $\gamma$:

```{r gamma-plot}
#| fig.alt: "Density plot of gamma chains"
ggplot(chains, aes(x = gamma, fill = factor(chain))) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(
    title = "Density plot of gamma chains",
    x = "Value",
    y = "Density",
    fill = "Chain"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
