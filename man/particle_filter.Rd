\arguments{
\item{y}{A numeric vector of observations.}

\item{n}{A positive integer specifying the number of particles.}

\item{init_fn}{A function that initializes the particle states. It should
accept an integer (the number of particles) as its first argument and return
a vector or matrix of initial particle states.}

\item{transition_fn}{A function describing the state transition model. It
should take the current particles and the current time step as arguments and
return the propagated particles.}

\item{log_likelihood_fn}{A function that computes the log likelihoods for the
particles. It should accept an observation, the current particles, and the
current time step as arguments and return a numeric vector of log likelihood
values.}

\item{algorithm}{A character string specifying the particle filtering
algorithm. Options are:
  \describe{
    \item{"SIS"}{Sequential Importance Sampling (without resampling).}
    \item{"SISR"}{Sequential Importance Sampling with resampling at every
    time step.}
    \item{"SISAR"}{SIS with adaptive resampling based on ESS.}
  }
  The default is \code{"SISAR"}.}

\item{resample_fn}{A character string specifying the resampling method
(used with \code{"SISR"} or \code{"SISAR"}). Options include:
  \describe{
    \item{"stratified"}{(default) Stratified resampling.}
    \item{"systematic"}{Systematic resampling.}
    \item{"multinomial"}{Multinomial resampling.}
  }}

\item{threshold}{A numeric value specifying the ESS threshold for triggering
resampling in the \code{"SISAR"} algorithm. If not provided, it defaults to
\code{n / 2}.}

\item{return_particles}{A logical value indicating whether to return the full
particle history. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{init_fn},
\code{transition_fn}, and \code{log_likelihood_fn}.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \describe{
    \item{state_est}{A numeric vector of estimated states over time,
    computed as the weighted average of particles.}
    \item{ess}{A numeric vector of the Effective Sample Size (ESS) at each
    time step.}
    \item{loglike}{The accumulated log-likelihood of the observations given
    the model.}
    \item{algorithm}{A character string indicating the filtering algorithm
    used.}
    \item{particles_history}{(Optional) A matrix of particle states over
    time (one row per time step), returned if \code{return_particles}
    is \code{TRUE}.}
    \item{weights_history}{(Optional) A matrix of particle weights over time
    (one row per time step), returned if \code{return_particles} is
    \code{TRUE}.}

\description{
This function implements a particle filter for estimating the hidden states
in a state space model using sequential Monte Carlo methods. Three filtering
variants are supported:
\enumerate{
  \item \strong{SIS:} Sequential Importance Sampling (without resampling).
  \item \strong{SISR:} Sequential Importance Sampling with resampling at
  every time step.
  \item \strong{SISAR:} SIS with adaptive resampling based on the Effective
  Sample Size (ESS). Resampling is triggered when the ESS falls below a
  given threshold (default \code{n / 2}).
}
}
\details{
The particle filter is a sequential Monte Carlo method that approximates the
posterior distribution of the state in a state space model. The three
supported algorithms differ in their approach to resampling:
\enumerate{
  \item \strong{SIS:} Particles are propagated and weighted without any
   resampling, which may lead to weight degeneracy over time.
  \item \strong{SISR:} Resampling is performed at every time step to combat
  weight degeneracy.
  \item \strong{SISAR:} Resampling is performed adaptively; particles are
  resampled only when the Effective Sample Size (ESS) falls below a
  specified threshold (defaulting to \code{n / 2}).
}
The Effective Sample Size (ESS) in context of particle filters is defined as
\deqn{ESS = \left(\sum_{i=1}^n w_i^2\right)^{-1},}
where \eqn{w_i} are the normalized weights of the particles.

The default resampling method is stratified resampling, as Douc et al., 2005
showed that it always gives a lower variance compared to
multinomial resampling.
